"""§17 end-to-end prompt suite runner.

Executes the prompt manifest one fresh process at a time, captures the model's
verbatim answer and the server-side trace separately, and writes a diffable run
directory. It does NOT score: pass/fail against the pinned criteria is a human
judgment, and Group A should be scored by someone with no project history.

    CONGRESS_API_KEY=... GOVINFO_API_KEY=... \
        python -m tests.e2e.run_suite --run-dir runs/2026-08-09 --cells floor,ceiling

    python -m tests.e2e.run_suite --cells cross-vendor-floor    # the Codex Luna cell
    python -m tests.e2e.run_suite --dry-run     # validate manifest + layout, call nothing

The harness writes its own MCP config per prompt, pointing the CLI at this repo's server
on stdio (`python -m congress_api --transport stdio`) with --strict-mcp-config, so the
tool surface is configuration rather than whatever the operator happens to have
registered -- and so the isolation cell's three tools and the floor/ceiling full surface
are real settings. The config names NO credential in any form -- the stdio child
inherits the environment, and an unset ${VAR} would arrive as that literal string and
override the working key.

THE DRIVER IS PART OF THE INSTRUMENT (§17 driver-axis ruling, 2026-08-18). Each cell in
the manifest declares its own `driver` (claude or codex), and a cell is identified by
(driver, model, effort, surface, context condition, prompt variant) -- two cells that
differ in driver also differ in system prompt, tool-call formatting, and client-side
behavior the server trace cannot see, so a Claude-Codex disagreement is a cross-instrument
observation, never attributed to the model alone. The measurement itself is
driver-agnostic BY CONSTRUCTION -- the trace is the SERVER's JSONL, not the model's own
account -- so switching drivers changes who is being measured without changing how. Only
the invocation differs, and each driver's flags encode the SAME two guarantees:
(1) the operator's own tool surface is shut out (Claude --strict-mcp-config; Codex
--ignore-user-config, which drops the operator's config.toml -- and its MCP servers,
including an unrelated `congressmcp-dev` pointed at a different install -- while still
loading auth from CODEX_HOME), and (2) the only way to answer is the traced congress
tools. Claude enforces (2) by denying its built-ins; Codex has no per-tool deny, so it
runs in the read-only sandbox with approval_policy="never" -- every escalation denied
-- while the congress server's tools are pre-approved per-server
(default_tools_approval_mode="approve"), so the only grant approval can ever make is a
traced congress call. The web channel needed its own campaign, all of it measured (see
CODEX_NOWEB_PROVIDER and the probe records): ChatGPT auth attaches the backend web.run
tool nothing client-side removes; the builtin API provider registers the CLI's own web
tool (functions.web__run) that survives every tools.* config; and --approve-for-me's
automatic reviewer approves the model's own sandbox-escape requests. The resolution is
a custom no-web provider over the Responses API plus "never" approvals -- so a grounded
answer has nowhere to come from but the MCP server. The provider authenticates via
OPENAI_API_KEY, resolved at preflight and delivered by process env only. Both configurations are
ASSERTED against the argv actually executed and recorded per cell as `builtins_disabled`,
in each driver's own vocabulary (never translated -- Codex `reasoning_effort` is not a
Claude thinking budget, and no mapping between the scales is recorded anywhere). Codex
model ids differ from Claude's; a Claude model id handed to codex fails loudly at the
CLI, never silently.

The CLI runs in an empty temp directory OUTSIDE this repo. It resolves project context by
walking up from its working directory, so anywhere inside the repo -- including the
default run directory -- hands the model CLAUDE.md, the source, the spec, and the git
history. One run answered "I had to identify H.R. 3838 from your git history" before this
was fixed.

THE CACHE AXIS (§17-PR2, 2026-08-22). PR 2 gave the server a persistent bill-text
cache, and a persistent cache is shared state between invocations: a timing observed
on a cell that inherited the platform-default cache dir -- or another prompt's -- is
uninterpretable, and cross-prompt reuse is undisclosed shared state of the same family
as the cold-cwd rule. So every invocation gets a FRESH, EMPTY cache directory created
by the harness outside the repo, passed to the spawned server as CONGRESSMCP_CACHE_DIR
(beside CONGRESSMCP_TRACE_DIR / CONGRESSMCP_BILL_TEXT_ONLY), and recorded in meta.json
as `cache: {dir, mode, ...}`. Mode `cold` (the default, required for every
timing-sensitive cell) is that empty directory. Mode `warm` names packages in the
cell config; the harness warms them by DIRECT server-side calls through the tool
function (tests/e2e/warm_cache.py, a separate process with the trace switch off, so
the warming never burns a model turn and never appears in the cell's trace), asserts
each named package file exists on disk and that the cell's trace is still empty, and
only then runs the prompt in a fresh process against that directory. The warmed
package ids and each warm call's envelope fields are recorded in meta.json.

THE CENTRAL HAZARD, restated from §17: automation is the easiest place to silently
violate the method. A script that runs all prompts in one session, appends a diagnostic
instruction, or reads the model's own account of its tool calls produces numbers that
look like §17 and measure something else. Every invariant below is one of the method's
rules turned into a machine constraint, and each is asserted rather than assumed.
