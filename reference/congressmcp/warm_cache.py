"""Pre-warm a cell's bill-text cache by DIRECT server-side calls (§17-PR2).

    CONGRESSMCP_CACHE_DIR=<cell cache dir> python tests/e2e/warm_cache.py < specs.json

stdin is a JSON list of package specs, each {"package_id", "congress",
"bill_type", "number", "version"}; stdout is a JSON list of per-package
records. The harness (run_suite.run_one) spawns this once per warm cell,
BEFORE the prompt's CLI process, and then asserts on disk that every named
package file exists -- the warm state is verified, never assumed.

WHY A SUBPROCESS, AND WHY THE TOOL FUNCTION. §17-PR2: "the harness pre-warms
by direct server-side calls for the named packages before the prompt -- never
by burning a model turn." Warming through a model turn would put a consumer
call in the measurement and make the cell's first real call look warm because
a prior model call was not. So the warm call goes straight through the tool
function (get_bill_toc, depth=1 -- the cheapest call that drives the full
resolve/download/parse/index/publish path) in a process whose environment
carries the cell's CONGRESSMCP_CACHE_DIR and NO trace dir: the warming calls
must not appear in the cell's trace, so this process refuses to start if
CONGRESSMCP_TRACE_DIR is set. A separate process also keeps the harness's own
interpreter free of the server's process-wide store (service.get_store() binds
to the cache dir on first use).

WHAT "WARM" MEANS HERE. One call per named package with version=None -- the
shape a consumer's first call takes -- so that BOTH the package file and the
version-resolution row (the CONGRESSMCP_VERSION_TTL "cached" path) are warm,
exactly the state a server is in after having served this bill once. If the
resolved package is not the named one (the named version is not current), a
second, explicit-version call guarantees the named package is on disk; both
calls are recorded. Every call's envelope fields that matter for reading the
cell (package_id, version_resolution, cache.index_hit/version_hit, timing)
are returned verbatim so the meta row can disclose what the warm did.

Never prints a credential: the only values that leave this process are tool
envelope fields and file stats.
