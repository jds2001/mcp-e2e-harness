"""Spawn shim: inject credentials from a 0600 file, then exec the MCP server.

OPERATORS NEVER CREATE OR PASS THE SECRETS FILE. The interface is the same as the
Claude driver's: export CONGRESS_API_KEY (optionally GOVINFO_API_KEY) in the shell
that runs the harness. run_suite.write_secrets_file reads those from the harness's
own environment, writes the transient 0600 file, wires its path into the generated
codex config, and deletes it when the run ends. --secrets-file is plumbing between
the harness and this shim, not an operator input.

Why this exists (F29/F30 postmortem, maintainer directive 2026-08-19): Codex does NOT
forward the parent environment to the MCP servers it spawns, so the inheritance channel
the Claude driver uses delivers nothing there -- the server came up keyless and wore a
misleading error for it (F31). And every channel Codex *does* offer is an artifact:
the config env table is written to mcp-config.toml in the run directory, and the -c
overrides land verbatim in meta.json's `command`. A key riding either would be published
with the run.

So the key travels through a channel that leaves no artifact: this shim reads KEY=VALUE
lines from a mode-0600 file OUTSIDE the run tree (written by the harness at startup,
deleted when the run ends), puts them in its own environment, and execs the real server.
Only the file's PATH appears in run artifacts; the values exist on disk transiently,
readable by the operator alone.

The shim refuses a file readable by group or other: a 0644 secrets file next to a run
someone tars up is exactly the disclosure trace-constraint 1 exists to prevent, and
refusing loudly at spawn beats trusting every caller to have set the mode.

It never prints a value. Errors name the file and the fix, not the contents.
